🛡️ SafeSite - Construction PPE & Worker Tracking App
📱 Project Overview
SafeSite is a mobile-first application built to enhance safety and operational oversight on construction sites. The application provides real-time tracking of workers, monitors PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) compliance, and identifies safety violations as they happen. This project was developed as a part of an academic initiative under Critical Thinking, Design Thinking, Leadership, and Framework.

🎯 Problem Statement
Construction environments are inherently hazardous, and lack of proper PPE or monitoring can lead to serious injuries. SafeSite addresses these challenges by providing:

Live tracking of worker movement within the construction site.

Automatic detection of PPE compliance using digital checks.

Notifications for safety breaches or unauthorized access.

Historical logs and reports for audits and compliance checks.
